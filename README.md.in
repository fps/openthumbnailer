# openthumbnailer

A little program to write video thumbnails based on OpenCV. It should work as is on Linux and OS X. You will probably need to make minor modifications to make it work on Windows. Please send patches if you figure it out..

# Requirements

* <code>setitimer</code>
* <code>SIGVTALARM</code>
* <code>boost::program_options</code>
* OpenCV2

# Usage

<code>for n in /path/to/your/video/collection/*; do ./openthumbnailer -i "$n" -o "$n".%010d.jpg --frame-advance 10000 ; done</code>

# Issues

Possible code injection via ouput format string as it uses snprintf and I'm too lazy to figure the out the safe C++ way to do this.
